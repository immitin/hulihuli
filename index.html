    <h2>...and the animals in my life: </h2>
    
    <p>My family has had cats as pets as long as I can remember. So obviously, when I moved out I had to get one. Or two.<br> 
      And I'm already on round two with two cats. </p>
      
      <p>The main reasons why I got cats, and not dogs (yet) are </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>I dont't have to take them out when it's raining </li>
        <li>They can handle themselfs most of the time </li>
        <li>They don't bark. They kinda sound like Predator, thouhg.</li>
    </ol>
    
      <p>I've had these two dumbdumbs for quite some time now. They are like Pinky and Brain in a way. <br>
    The one on the left is Unto Penjami. He's a bit younger than Ihaa, and for some part it explains why he's more like Pinky. <br>
    One on the right is Ihaa (Eeyore). I guess he's the brains, because he's older. Usually he just sits and stares. </p>
    
    <p> Best things about them 
    <ul> 
      <li>Fluffy</li>
      <li>Always there</li>
      <li>Always happy to see you </li> 
    </ul>
    </p>
