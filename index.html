    <h2>...and the animals in my life: </h2>
    
    <p>My family has had cats as pets as long as I can remember. So obviously, when I moved out I had to get one. Or two.<br> 
      And I'm already on round two with two cats. Yeah. I'm <em>that</em> old. </p>
      
    <p>The main reasons why I got <ins>cats</ins>, and not <ins>dogs</ins> (yet) are </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>I dont't have to take them out when it's raining </li>
        <li>They can handle themselfs most of the time </li>
        <li>They don't bark. Though sometimes they sound like Predator.</li>
    </ol>
    
     <p>Anyways, I've had these two dumbdumbs for quite some time now. They are like Pinky and Brain in a way. <br>
    The one on the left is Unto Penjami. He's a bit younger than Ihaa, and for some part that explains why he's more like Pinky, and zero brain. <br>
    One on the right is Ihaa (Eeyore). I guess he's the brains, because he usually just sits and stares to the darkness. </p>
