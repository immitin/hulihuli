        <h4>Little bit of history</h4>
          
    <p>My family has had cats as long as I can remember. So obviously, when I moved out I had to get one. Or two. 
      And I'm already on round two with two cats. Yeah. I'm <em>that</em> old. </p>

            <h4> Love it, because...</h4>       
      <ol>
        <li>I dont't have to take them out when it's raining </li>
        <li>They can handle themselfs most of the time </li>
        <li>They don't bark. Though sometimes they sound like Predator.</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>What are they like</h3>
     <p>I've had these two dumbdumbs for quite some time now. They are like Pinky and Brain in a way. 
       The one on the left is Unto Penjami. He's a bit younger than Ihaa, and for some part that explains why he's more like Pinky, and zero brain. 
    One on the right is Ihaa (Eeyore). He is usually the brains, because he usually doesn't run around doing stupid stuff, but sits and stares to the darkness. </p>
