        My all time favourite pets are Karjalainen (the one on the back) and Korppi. Korppi is the black one on the front.

    <h4> How did this happen </h4>
    
      <p class="license">I got my drivers license for motorcycle in 2009. Back then I "didn't have" neither the money or time to get a motorcycle, <br>
      so it took me almost ten years before I actually drove a motorcycle for a whole summer. That summer I had many hard <br> 
        decisions to make in the morning, thanks to my sisters. </p>

    <h4> Summer of 2018 my vehicles were</h4>

      <li>Blue Kawasaki ZX-6R</li>

      <h4>What followed</h4>
      
      <p class="license">  After that summer I decided to have my own motorcycle.
        It was love at first sight - the previous owner had named the Kawasaki ZX-6RR "Korppi", Raven, <br> 
        so it kinda just stuck. For sure, I'd like to get a bigger one, maybe 1000cc, but Korppi is good for now! And what comes to that Karjalainen pet... <br>
        Well, we went for a date and the date just never ended. </p>
