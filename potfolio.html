        Yet, my all time favourite pets are Karjalainen (the one on the back) and Korppi. He's the black one on the front.

      <p>I got my drivers licence for motorcycle in XXXX. Back then I "didn't have" neither the money or time to get a motorcycle, <br>
      so it took me more than ten years before I actually drove a motorcycle for a whole summer. And it was the blue one in the next picture. <br> 
      After that summer I decided to have my own motorcycle. It was actually love at first sight - the previous owner had named it "Korppi", Raven, so it <br> 
      kinda just stuck. Korppi is a Kawasaki ZX-6RR. For sure, I'd like to get a bigger one, maybe 1000cc, but Korppi is good for now! </p>
