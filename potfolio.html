        My all time favourite pets are Karjalainen (the one on the back) and Korppi. Korppi is the black one on the front.

    <h4> How did this happen </h4>
    
      <p class="license">I got my drivers licence for motorcycle in 2009.
        Back then I "didn't have" neither the money or time to get a motorcycle,
      so it took me almost ten years before I actually drove a motorcycle for a whole summer.
  That summer I had many hard decisions, thanks to my sisters. </p>

    <h4> Summer of 2018 my vehicles were</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Blue CitroÃ«n 2CV (which didn't make the picture because slllllooooooow)</li>
      <li>Blue Kawasaki ZX-6R</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>What followed</h4>
      
      <p class="license">  After that summer I decided to have my own motorcycle.
        It was love at first sight - the previous owner had named the Kawasaki ZX-6RR "Korppi",
      Raven, so it kinda just stuck. For sure, I'd like to get a bigger one, maybe 1000cc, but Korppi is good for now!
      And what comes to that Karjalainen pet... Well, we went for a date and the date just never ended. </p>
