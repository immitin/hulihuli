<header>TWO MORE PETS OF MY LIFE </header>
    
     <div>
      <p id="license">I got my drivers licence for motorcycle in 2009. Back then I "didn't have" neither the money or time to get a motorcycle, <br>
      so it took me almost ten years before I actually drove a motorcycle for a whole summer. It was my sisters, and it is the blue one in the picture below. <br> 
      After that summer I decided to have my own motorcycle. It was love at first sight - the previous owner had named the Kawasaki ZX-6RR "Korppi", <br>
      Raven, so it kinda just stuck. For sure, I'd like to get a bigger one, maybe 1000cc, but Korppi is good for now! </p>

        My all time favourite pets are Karjalainen (the one on the back) and Korppi. Korppi is the black one on the front.
